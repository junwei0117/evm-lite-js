[..monetd] $ monetd help config build

The build subcommand initialises the bare-bones configuration to get started 
with monetd. It uses one of the accounts from the keystore to define a network 
consisting of a unique node, which is automatically added to the PoA whitelist.
Additionally, all the accounts in [datadir]/keystore are credited with a large
amount of tokens in the genesis file. This command is mostly used for testing.

If the --address flag is omitted, the first non-loopback address for this 
instance is used.

Usage:
  monetd config build [moniker] [flags]

Flags:
      --address string    IP/hostname of this node (default "172.17.0.1")
  -h, --help              help for build
      --passfile string   file containing the passphrase

Global Flags:
  -d, --datadir string   top-level directory for configuration and data (default "/home/jon/.monet")
  -v, --verbose          verbose output
